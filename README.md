Hello Developers , I am Shasank

Welcome to the project! This is a multiplatform React Native application designed to run on both Android and iOS devices. 

## Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions until the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start


Step 2: Start Your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

For Android
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android

Step 3: Modifying Your App
Now that you have successfully run the app, you can modify it.

Open App.tsx in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.

For Android: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows and Linux, or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) to see your changes!

For iOS: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!


Congratulations! :tada:
